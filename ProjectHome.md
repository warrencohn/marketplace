Marketplace was developed at the University of Michigan in 2001 and has provided a continuous service to the campus community since then.  It offers a place to tell people that you either have stuff you want to get rid of, or stuff you want to acquire.  Adverts are divided into many categories for easy searching.

At the time of adding this project to Google Code the application's authentication relies on a University of Michigan service and so is not portable.  However, that aspect of the application could be changed without impacting the function of the rest of it.
