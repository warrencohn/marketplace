Jul12/08    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            
            The database model and associated in-memory structures have been changed quite radically.
            
            (a) only one model now
            (b) stopped using database [sharing] for inter-instance communication
            
            We now use three in-memory structures for the retention of database information:
            
            (a) ApplicationModel (just one) -- holds the 'unchanging' information: categories and their 
                names, and 'active' adverts (and a list of 'recent' adverts derived directly from 'active').
                The advert lists aren't really unchanging, but they change slowly (~100 times a day?), 
                so are refreshed as needed.
                 
            (b) UserSessionModel (one per session) -- is a repository of 'session-duration' info including 
                information about the logged in customer, as well as the adverts that they authored and the 
                adverts in their favorites.  We also keep category advert lists when they are invoked by 
                the user.
            
            The ApplicationModel and UserSessionModel are completely independent and know NOTHING about 
            each other.  Because of this, and because the ApplicationModel editing context isn't shared (and
            maybe it should be, but I'm scared of EOSharedEditingContext), we have two copies of the 
            category data.  The UserSessionModel needs it to allow category relations to be established for 
            newly created adverts.
                 
            (c) AdvertList (transient) -- this holds the list of adverts being displayed on screen, whatever
                their origin (recent, favorites, category or found).

Mar24/08    ================================================================================ advance to v2.0

			MP is now entirely built in Eclipse/WOLips ...
			MP now makes extensive use of CSS for layout ...
            
Dec11/07    ------------------------------------------------ advance to v1.5.11

            Do not allow Friend accounts access
            Correct stylesheet URL in error pages (kludge)
            Add application start time to the footer

Oct01/07    ------------------------------------------------ advance to v1.5.10

            Correct typo in error message

Sep12/07    ------------------------------------------------ advance to v1.5.9

            Change footer to show port# as "AppID"

            A little cleanup of the "page < 1 2 3 >" page selector.
            
            But I'm really hunting for the NPE we sometimes get in the
            code that generates this navigation.  I found an off-by-one
            error, though I can't see how it would cause this.

            Changed batching from 10, 20, 30 ... to 10, 25, 50, 100

Jul11/07    ------------------------------------------------ advance to v1.5.8

            no changes in application, but new UMBrowser used in ITCSSession
            to detect if the user is using an iPhone.  We don't do anything
            except log this so far, but we probably ought to make some of the
            accommodations that Apple recommends.

            'deny list', Friend accounts and reduction in use of ITCSUser class
            marketplace now does not need the ITCSMarketplace framework -- 
               the methods and resources have been moved into the application.
            beginnings of category editor:  ".../wa/catEdit"
            application init moved out of constructor to notification method
            Marketplace has it's own MPPanel, replacing use of ITCSPanel
            Slight change to some graphics, more anti-aliasing to come ...
            refactor a couple of methods from "search" to "MPComponent"
            change the RECENT ads panel title to say "up to fifty most recent"
                (and change the number from 5 to 50)
            
Jan15/07    ------------------------------------------------ advance to v1.5.5

Nov17/05 	------------------------------------------------ advance to v1.5.1

Nov17/05 	Clean up the base-application.properties as follows:
            -- remove all logging related properties so we use WebObject's own
               destination for logs (set in Monitor). (gav)

11/14/05 	Email the developer if we get the MPFooter NullPointerException so 
			we can try to figure out why we are getting this error.  This error 
			occurs infrequently, but it has been occurring for a very long time.  
			It results in the "It's not your fault" error page. (phayes)
		 
		 	Related change in ITCSFoundation.ITCSErrorHandler: make 
			emailNotify() public so that other classes can use it (phayes)

11/3/05		Change base-application.properties so that watsmon is watsopsmon
